# 🤖 Akhil Talashi
**Full-Stack + AI Systems Engineer**

Building production-ready AI systems: LLM applications, RAG pipelines, and intelligent workflows that solve real problems at scale.

> 3+ years shipping full-stack systems | 1.5+ years focused on production AI | Pragmatic builder, not a toy-demo engineer.

---

## 🎯 What I Build

**AI-First Systems**
- LLM-powered applications & AI assistants (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with semantic search and vector databases
- End-to-end intelligent workflows: data → retrieval → inference → user interface
- Clean, maintainable production APIs (FastAPI, Python)

**Full-Stack Engineering**
- Scalable backend systems (Node.js, Python, Spring Boot, microservices)
- User-centric frontends (React, Next.js, TypeScript)
- Cloud infrastructure & DevOps (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- Database design and optimization (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)

**Why This Matters**
I don't separate "AI engineering" from "full-stack engineering"—they're one discipline. Real AI systems need both. I build the entire stack: APIs, data pipelines, inference layers, and interfaces that users actually use.

## 💡 Philosophy & Approach

**Pragmatic AI Engineering**
- Shipping beats perfection. Real user feedback > theoretical optimization.
- Clean code + testing = systems that scale and don't break.
- Full-stack ownership: I own my features from database to UI.

**Production First**
- Latency, cost, and maintainability matter. Every design decision has tradeoffs.
- "Works in my notebook" doesn't count. Systems must work at scale.
- Monitoring and observability are non-negotiable.

**Team > Solo**
- Great products are built by great teams. I champion collaboration and clarity.
- Mentoring & knowledge sharing are part of engineering excellence.
- Communication skills are as important as coding skills.
